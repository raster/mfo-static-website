Logos
-----

Here you'll find the official Maker Faire Orlando logos to download and use for promotional purposes.

The rules are simple: don't use them in a way that makes people think we've endorsed anyone's products or services, and when you use one on a website, it should link back to makerfaireorlando.com. If you do something neat with them on one of your projects, please let us know.
